PaRTiKle overview
=================

PaRTiKle is a real time kernel designed to be POSIX compatible.
The native API is ``C'' POSIX threads.

It is a full-featured, flexible, configurable, real time embedded
kernel. The kernel provides thread scheduling, synchronization, timer,
and communication primitives. It handles hardware resources such as
interrupts, exceptions, memory, timers, etc.

PaRTiKle API
============

PaRTiKle implements the PSE51 interface. Furthermore, to ease the
transition from RTLinux to PaRTiKle, PaRTiKle also gives support for the
RTLinux's *_np routines.

Supported Languages
===================

- C is fully supported.

- C++ mechanisms (inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, ...) are
  fully supported. However, the porting of the C++ run-time library
  is not available so far.

* Although ALPHA versions of PaRTiKle already supported Java (GCJ) and
Ada (GNAT), we'd rather remove this support till we have checked that
it's working properly. Anyway, we don't discard to release the GCJ and
the GNAT support as two add-on packages.
