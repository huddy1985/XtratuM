This contains some code to work with the lpc2000 devices
in particular the LPC2136, it contains support for:
	- arm7 initialization code,
	- interrupts
	- serial uart
	- rtc/timers
	- thumb
	- ...

and it's been an attempt to develop a sane codebase
to build other projects on top of it, that results 
easy to use & maintain. The first project has been
adding PaRTiKLe support for lpc2000.
