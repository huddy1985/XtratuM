and last run the corresponding examples acordingly

# cross compilation on 64 bits host to 32 bits target
see the instruction provided in mkfiles/mkfile-{linux,i386}

# configuration file:
One of the main benefits is that of having fully
customised kernels, that are defined by a configuration file (say
prtkcf), so one can start with a copy of the provided prtkcf and
prepare a configuration file to build a kernel that is especially
suited for the the task that the kernel/application are going to
perform.

# filesystem:
We don't need user/group/others permissions, at some point just rwx
could be enough, but currently, even x could be prescindible.
Operations over files (all resources should be named -> all resources
should be files)

Minimal builtin root fs: core/kernel/prot/devroot.c
core/kernel/linux/prtkcf [1] & [2] By now devroot.c implements a
minimal builtin fs, but consider having a devfs to multiplex
filesystem requests to all the files accesible {devices, files, etc.}

Consider a device (devhost.c) that allows access to the Linux (host)
filesystem from PaRTiKle.  Also linux trace.c cound be implemented as
a device devtrace.c and use devhost.c to write a linux trace file.

# devices
/* generic device open function, to be called from open_sys?
 * - functionality to provide generic {dev}open functions to fill each
     particular device tables devtab.  
 * - more ...
 */

Currently a device driver x (devx.c) [1] can only manage a set of
files of the form: /dev/{x,x0,x1,x2,...,xn}, diferentiating the files
by it's minor number.  It's also interesting to have
/dev/{cons,null,zero,drivers}, managed by the same devcons.c
