Steps to run posixtestsuite for Partikle:

1) Download a copy from posixtesuite.
2) Extract it under the current directory.
3) Apply the patch provided "posixtestsuite-partikle.patch" which 
   contains a clean copy of the Posix Test Suite with minor changes needed 
   to compile and test Partikle.

So far, only the Linux_i386 target has been tested.

Note that Partikle implements a minimal POSIX thred system. Therefore,
system calls for regular (heavy) processes may not work or even
exist at all.

To test the pthread_mutex_timedlock's conformance with the standard, run:

$ export POSIX_TARGET=conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/
$ make

The result should be something like:
conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/1-1: build: PASS
conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/1-1: link: PASS
conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/2-1: build: PASS
conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/2-1: link: PASS
conformance/interfaces/pthread_mutex_timedlock/4-1: build: PASS

Good work Miguel!
