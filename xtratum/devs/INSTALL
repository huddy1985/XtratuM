Introducation
	
	By far, the  UART, FIFO, SHM has been updated to meet the new device driver model. In the new model, The drivers are divide into two parts which are separated into linux module and domain-driver respectively. Resouce initilization and release located in linux module and the driver body run as a driver domain on XtratuM. There are two important resouce are managed by the driver, one is memory and another is interrupt. Memory allocation and interrupt request consist of initilization module. And the ISR (interrupt service routine) run in the domain. In some driver, the interrupt is not neccessary, such as there is no interrupt in the FIFO driver.

	In the document, the installation of xtratum device driver will be presented. XM/FIFO, XM/SHM and  XM/UART has been integrated into the new device driver model. Before reading the document you should know read XtratuM_PATH/INSTALL file and know how to install XtratuM system.

Installation
	
	The installation of the device driver is simple. It start from the Linux-kernel-xm has boot.
	#cd XtratuM_PATH

	Compile the xtratum normally.

	Load xtratum, rtfifo, serial, module by xm_pathc/user_tools/scripts/xmcmd.sh command.
	# ../user_tools/scripts/xmcmd.sh -l
	
	Running serial device driver:
		# cd user_tools/serial/
		# make
		# ../xmloader/loader.xm serial.xmd -prio 1 /* You can set it by yourself*/	
		# cd -

	Check the result:
		# lsmod 
		lshm                    3924  0 
		shm                     5664  1 lshm
		lfifo                   3200  0 
		luart                   4136  0 
		rtfifo                  4640  1 lfifo
		serial                  6052  1 luart
		xm                     38056  3 shm,rtfifo,serial
		# cat /proc/xtratum

        		Intercepted events: 0xffff
        		Masked events: 0xffff0000
        		Pending events: 0x0
        		Events' flag is enabled
        		Current state: ACTIVE

Testing
	XM/FIFO TESIING
		The test suits for XM/FIFO are located in partikle/user/examples/c_examples/ directory.
	XM/SHM  TESTING
		SHM testing suits are built for XtratuM and PaRTiKle, so you can use user_tools/examples/shm/* to test XtratuM and use partikle/user/examples/c_examples/shm/* to test PaRTiKel.
	XM/UART TESTING
		xtratum/user_tools/tests/* files are uart testing suites for test the uart communication.

	All the testing suits for Linux system is located in xtratum/devs/[devs_name]/linux/examples/ driectory. The devs_name can be shm, serial, rtfifo.
