XtratuM serial driver speed testing

The testing platform consists of two parts: server and client. The server write the data into the virtual serial device with the package size is 1024Bs. And the client read data from the virtual serial device. When the virtual serial is empty, the domain will go to sleep, and the period is 200000ns. (I try to change the client period value, and the speed doesn't change).
